# Changelog

All notable changes to WebTerm. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
The number in parentheses after *agent* is `AGENT_VERSION` from `agent/ptyd.py` — agents refuse any
update carrying a lower one, so it only ever moves forward.

Entries say **why** a change exists, not only what changed. A fix without its cause tends to come
back.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-08-09 · agent (40)

### Added — you find out when someone attaches to your terminal

- **Attach notifications.** The viewer count already existed, but it changed *silently*: you
  learned that a second client was on your session only if you happened to be looking at that
  corner of the toolbar at that second — and if you were working, you were not looking. Every
  client already attached now gets an `attached` event, raised to a system notification, so it
  reaches you with the tab in the background.
- **Device identity in the viewer list.** The roster carried a count and a role, which cannot
  tell your own phone apart from a stranger — so there was nothing to act on. It now carries the
  IP and a short browser label per client, next to the existing kick button.
- **Unfamiliar devices are flagged and emailed.** A client attaching from an address never seen
  on a successful login for the account is marked *new device* in the list, its notification is
  raised to a warning, and an email goes out (throttled to one per address per 15 minutes, so
  five tabs from one new place send one message). Attaches from familiar addresses stay quiet —
  an alert that fires constantly is an alert nobody reads, and then the one that mattered is
  unread too. Guests arriving through a share link always count as unfamiliar: the link was
  given deliberately, but the moment it is *used* is exactly what you want to know.

Device identity here decides **how loud to be, never whether to check**. Nothing in this release
lets a recognised device skip step-up, the idle lock, or 2FA. That is deliberate: an IP and a
user-agent both travel with a stolen session cookie, so a "trusted device" bypass would be
waved through by precisely the attacker it appears to stop — and it would trade the idle lock's
5-minute exposure window for permanent access.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-08-08 · agent (40)

Everything here came out of nine external audits run against 2.0.0 before it was announced.
Two findings could only be found by breaking something on purpose, which is why they had
survived a year of code review.

### Fixed — things that looked like defences and were not

- **The automatic rollback never rolled back.** `deploy.sh` exports `WEBTERM_IMAGE` with the new
  tag and then `exec`s `rollback.sh`; `exec` inherits the environment, and compose prefers it
  over `.env`. So the rollback rewrote `.env`, `up -d app` re-resolved to the image it was
  fleeing, and the container stayed broken — while `.env` and `.prev-image` ended up swapped,
  pointing the manual rollback at the broken image too. RUNBOOK listed this as a defence layer.
- **`restore.sh` restored into a volume nothing used and reported success.** Docker silently
  creates a missing volume; the restore succeeded into it, exit 0, "restore OK", while the live
  app kept its own empty one. The name comes from the install directory, so it is wrong by
  default on any machine that is not `/opt/webterm` — which is exactly the rebuild procedure
  being copied between hosts. `backup.sh` had the guard; `restore.sh` did not.
- **`GET /api/search` read the contents of every transcript and left no audit trail**, while
  the same class of read through `/transcript`, `/fs/download` and `/preview` all did. After a
  stolen cookie, the log answered "nothing".
- **A missing `alive` field closed live sessions.** One loop tolerated it and read `None` as
  falsy, i.e. "it died" — `on_exit` plus `reap`, killing the real tmux session on the host.
- **Uninstalling could delete the user's entire crontab** when `crontab -l` failed for any
  transient reason, because the empty result was written back.
- **Security alerts switched themselves off**: compose passes `WEBTERM_ALERT_FROM` present and
  empty, so it never fell back to `SMTP_USER` and email alerts silently disabled themselves.
- **Deleting an account left its API tokens alive** for up to a year, because revocation keyed
  on the email, which `update_account` can change. Tokens and shares now key on the account id.

### Fixed — resource exhaustion and unbounded growth

- A compromised agent could adopt unlimited sessions (3000 rows and 6000 open files from one
  heartbeat) until the gateway's disk filled — taking the whole fleet with it. Adoption is
  capped per host and refused visibly.
- Agent-reported `hostname`, `user`, `update_blocked` and `metrics` are bounded; metrics are a
  whitelist of finite numbers, because a bare `Infinity` off the wire made the host page 500.
- Transcripts of closed sessions were never reclaimed: the retention only ever applied to
  sessions deleted by hand.
- Ports 80/443 were checked but nothing compressed the frontend: 904 KB on every cold load,
  18.6 s to first paint on 3G. Gzip in the application covers every deployment path.

### Fixed — installs and upgrades

- Installers refuse to start when the ports they would publish are taken, instead of leaving
  half a stack behind, and `setup.sh` asks compose which ports those actually are so the
  documented override recipe works.
- `.env` is parsed, not executed. Sourcing it as root meant a value with spaces broke the
  install and a value with `&&` ran commands.
- A second install can no longer hijack the first one's systemd units, whose names are fixed
  regardless of `--dir` — including the file holding the passphrase that decrypts its archives.
- The update notification pointed at `deploy.sh`, which changes the image only; half the system
  lives on the host and is synced by `upgrade.sh`.
- Getting the setup token wrong now counts down instead of locking you out without warning.

### Fixed — interface

- Romanian plurals go through `Intl.PluralRules`: "1 parametri" and "20 hosturi" are gone.
- Dates follow the chosen language and timezone; both settings existed and neither was applied.
- The file panel got the focus trap the other thirteen modals already had.
- The install command says it appends a line to `~/.bashrc`, on the screen where you copy it.
- Login and 2FA errors are translated; a host without tmux says so in words, where you work.

### Changed

- The published image is pinned by version rather than `:latest`, so a fresh install is
  reproducible and the rollback breadcrumb points at something real.
- `SECURITY.md` commits to a 7-day acknowledgement and a 30-day assessment, offers an address
  for people without a GitHub account, and states a safe harbour.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-08-07 · first public release · agent (37)

WebTerm was developed privately for about a year before this release. This is the first version
published as source, so the history below starts here rather than replaying that development.

Some documents cite `v1.0.x` versions when explaining why a piece of code looks the way it does.
Those tags belong to that private history and do not exist here; they are kept because the
reasoning is worth more than the version number. Any command you can copy and run refers to a
version that does exist.

### What it does

- **Persistent sessions.** Every session is a tmux session on the host. Close the browser, restart
  the gateway, kill the agent — the process keeps running and you reattach from anywhere,
  including a phone, from several devices at once.
- **Nothing listens on your servers.** A single-file Python agent dials *out* to the gateway over
  WebSocket, so a machine behind NAT or on a mobile connection works like one with a public IP.
- **Full history.** Each session records what came back on screen to a raw stream and an asciicast
  you can replay. Input is never recorded, so passwords typed at a prompt do not end up in the
  transcript or in a backup of it. Search runs across every session.
- **Files.** Browse, edit, upload and download over the same agent connection, with atomic saves
  and a conflict check on modification time.
- **Port forwarding.** Expose a service running on a host at its own subdomain, authenticated by
  the gateway, without opening a port on the host.
- **Telnet bastion and serial console.** Reach a switch, router or serial device on a host's
  private network as a normal session, without hopping through a shell first.
- **Fleet view.** Hosts with online status, load and disk, grouped into folders, plus running one
  command across several hosts at once.

### Security posture

- Password login plus **passkeys** (WebAuthn) or TOTP. Hosts can be marked *require 2FA*, which
  demands a second factor for connecting, reading history, browsing files, creating a port forward
  and probing one.
- **Signed agent updates.** Each deployment generates its own Ed25519 key at first boot; the
  gateway substitutes its public half into the agent it serves and signs every update with the
  private half. Agents refuse anything that does not verify, refuse older versions, and validate
  that a new release actually starts before replacing themselves.
- **Credential vault**, encrypted at rest. Backups you download, and those written by the
  installed timer, are encrypted with a passphrase you
  choose, because they contain the vault key.
- An **audit log** of every action that changes something, and of the reads that take data out —
  file downloads, transcripts, previews.
- The honest limits are documented rather than glossed: no roles, the gateway is a single point of
  total compromise, and it is built for one trusted administrator. See
  [docs/THREAT-MODEL.md](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md).

### Interface

- Terminal rendered with WebGL, falling back to canvas and then DOM.
- Tabs, split view, and popping a session into its own window.
- Works on phones and tablets: ten real device profiles are checked in CI on every build.
- Shell integration (OSC 133) marks commands so you can jump between them, see exit codes and
  copy a command with its output.
- English and Romanian, with the language chosen from the browser and switchable in settings.
  Adding a third is copying one file and translating the values.

### Requirements

A machine with Docker, and `tmux` plus Python 3 on each host you want to reach. Nothing else.
